| 1.1.8       | - Fix some issues when attempting to recycle items that are a part of a recipe but do not contain a recipe of their own. This mainly affected EpicLoot, but is also rarely found in Jewelcrafting<br/> - What this means is that you can recycle your enchanted items successfully, no matter the requirement, as long as you know the material if the recipe for it doesn't exist at the root.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 1.1.0       | - Provide full compatibility with Jewelcrafting. You can now get your gems inside the items back!<br/> - Provide as much compatibility with EpicLoot as possible. Sometimes the crafting UI breaks when using it. Recycling from your inventory works flawlessly though.<br/> - Recipes will now cycle if there are more than 4 items to be reclaimed. Very similar to Vanilla when there are more than 4 requirements to make something.<br/> - Please note that the AllowRecyclingUnknownRecipes and ReturnUnknownResources are respective to their sections and will also (like vanilla items) control the behaviour of Jewelcrafting and EpicLoot depending on which is on, and whether or not you are recycling from inventory...or reclaiming from the crafting area.<br/> - Additionally, returnEnchantedResources (on by default!) must be on to get your enchanted resources back. This means your gems or enchanted items depending on which mod you have installed. |
