# Description

## Repair pieces in a specified area around the player when using the hammer to repair. Code pulled from OdinsQOL


`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

`Feel free to reach out to me on discord if you need manual download assistance.`

Thank you to Daimkake#0233 for the mod icon! I'm lazy and don't really like making my own.
