### About the Mod:

#### now with ServerSync

#### Mistlands Compatible

This mod is a combination of my own code and scaled down version of Aedenthorn's AutoFuel mod.  

Credit goes to Aedenthorn for the idea and original mod.

--------------------

Fuels torches, campfires, windmills, spinning wheels, hearths, kilns and smelters from items in chests or off the ground

`A config file BepInEx/config/tastychickenlegs.automaticfuel.cfg is created after running the game once with this mod)`

For Servers that want to control ther configuration, install on the server and clients.  
The server config will push down.

For Servers that cannot use mods, simply install this on the clients only and it will work just fine.  Clients will all need
